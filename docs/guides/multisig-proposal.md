# Multisig Proposal

After adding FPS into project dependencies, the next step involves initiating the creation of the first Proposal contract. This example provides guidance on formulating a proposal for deploying new instances of `Vault.sol` and `MockToken`. These contracts are located in the [guides section](./introduction.md#example-contracts). The proposal includes the transfer of ownership of both contracts to a multisig wallet, along with the whitelisting of the token and minting of tokens to the multisig.

Proposal files are located in the `proposals` folder. Create a new file called `MULTISIG_01.sol` and add the following code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import {Vault} from "@examples/Vault.sol";
import {MockToken} from "@examples/MockToken.sol";
import {Addresses} from "@addresses/Addresses.sol";
import {MultisigProposal} from "@proposals/MultisigProposal.sol";

// MULTISIG_01 proposal deploys a Vault contract and an ERC20 token contract
// Then the proposal transfers ownership of both Vault and ERC20 to the multisig address
// Finally the proposal whitelist the ERC20 token in the Vault contract
contract MULTISIG_01 is MultisigProposal {
    // Returns the name of the proposal.
    function name() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "MULTISIG_01";
    }

    // Provides a brief description of the proposal.
    function description() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "Deploy Vault contract";
    }

    /// @notice Deploys a vault contract and an ERC20 token contract.
    /// @param addresses The addresses contract.
    function _deploy(Addresses addresses, address) internal override {
        if (!addresses.isAddressSet("VAULT")) {
            Vault timelockVault = new Vault();
            addresses.addAddress("VAULT", address(timelockVault), true);
        }

        if (!addresses.isAddressSet("TOKEN_1")) {
            MockToken token = new MockToken();
            addresses.addAddress("TOKEN_1", address(token), true);
        }
    }

    /// @notice proposal action steps:
    /// 1. Transfers vault ownership to dev multisig.
    /// 2. Transfer token ownership to dev multisig.
    /// 3. Transfers all tokens to dev multisig.
    /// @param addresses The addresses contract.
    function _afterDeploy(
        Addresses addresses,
        address deployer
    ) internal override {
        address devMultisig = addresses.getAddress("DEV_MULTISIG");
        Vault timelockVault = Vault(addresses.getAddress("VAULT"));
        MockToken token = MockToken(addresses.getAddress("TOKEN_1"));

        timelockVault.transferOwnership(devMultisig);
        token.transferOwnership(devMultisig);
        token.transfer(devMultisig, token.balanceOf(address(deployer)));
    }

    /// @notice Sets up actions for the proposal, in this case, setting the MockToken to active.
    /// @param addresses The addresses contract.
    function _build(
        Addresses addresses
    )
        internal
        override
        buildModifier(addresses.getAddress("DEV_MULTISIG"), addresses)
    {
        /// STATICCALL -- not recorded for the run stage
        address timelockVault = addresses.getAddress("VAULT");
        address token = addresses.getAddress("TOKEN_1");

        /// CALLS -- mutative and recorded
        Vault(timelockVault).whitelistToken(token, true);
    }

    /// @notice Executes the proposal actions.
    /// @param addresses The addresses contract.
    function _run(Addresses addresses, address) internal override {
        /// Call parent _run function to check if there are actions to execute
        super._run(addresses, address(0));

        address multisig = addresses.getAddress("DEV_MULTISIG");

        _simulateActions(multisig);
    }

    /// @notice Validates the post-execution state.
    /// @param addresses The addresses contract.
    function _validate(Addresses addresses, address) internal override {
        address devMultisig = addresses.getAddress("DEV_MULTISIG");
        Vault timelockVault = Vault(addresses.getAddress("VAULT"));
        MockToken token = MockToken(addresses.getAddress("TOKEN_1"));
        /// Validate post-execution state
        /// Vault ownership should be transferred to multisig
        assertEq(timelockVault.owner(), devMultisig);
        /// Token should be whitelisted on the Vault contract
        assertTrue(timelockVault.tokenWhitelist(address(token)));
        /// Vault should not be paused
        assertFalse(timelockVault.paused());

        /// Token ownership should be transferred to multisig
        assertEq(token.owner(), devMultisig);
        /// Token balance of multisig should be equal to total supply
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(devMultisig), token.totalSupply());
    }
}
```

Let's go through each of the functions that are overridden.

-   `name()`: Define the name of your proposal.
-   `description()`: Provide a detailed description of your proposal.
-   `_deploy()`: Deploy any necessary contracts. This example demonstrates the
    deployment of Vault and an ERC20 token. Once the contracts are deployed,
    they are added to the `Addresses` contract by calling `addAddress()`.
-   `_build()`: Set the necessary actions for your proposal. In this example, ERC20 token is whitelisted on the Vault contract. Use the `buildModifier` to ensure that the proposal is only executed by the timelock, which is owned by the governor. If the modifier is not used, actions will not be added to the proposal array and the calldata will be generated incorrectly.
-   `_run()`: Execute the proposal actions outlined in the `_build()` step. This
    function performs a call to `simulateActions()` from the inherited
    `MultisigProposal` contract. Internally, `_simulateActions()` simulates a call to the [Multicall3](https://www.multicall3.com/) contract with the calldata generated from the actions set up in the build step.
-   `_validate()`: This final step is crucial for validating the post-execution state. It ensures that the multisig is the new owner of Vault and token, the tokens were transferred to multisig and the token was whitelisted on the Vault contract

With the first proposal contract prepared, it's time to proceed with execution. There are two options available:

1. **Using `foundry test`**: Details on this method can be found in the [integration-tests.md](../testing/integration-tests.md "mention") section.
2. **Using `foundry script`**: This is the chosen method for this scenario.

Before proceeding with the `foundry script`, it is necessary to set up the
[Addresses](../overview/architecture/addresses.md) contract. The next step
involves creating an `addresses.json` file.

```json
[
    {
        "addr": "0x3dd46846eed8D147841AE162C8425c08BD8E1b41",
        "name": "DEV_MULTISIG",
        "chainId": 31337
    }
]
```

With the JSON file prepared for use with `Addresses.sol`, the next step is to create a script that inherits from `ScriptSuite`.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import {ScriptSuite} from "@forge-proposal-simulator/script/ScriptSuite.s.sol";
import {MULTISIG_01} from "proposals/MULTISIG_01.sol";

// @notice MultisigScript is a script that run MULTISIG_01 proposal
// MULTISIG_01 proposal deploys a Vault contract and an ERC20 token contract
// Then the proposal transfers ownership of both Vault and ERC20 to the multisig address
// Finally the proposal whitelist the ERC20 token in the Vault contract
// @dev Use this script to simulates or run a single proposal
// Use this as a template to create your own script
// `forge script script/MultisigScript.s.sol:MultisigScript -vvvv --rpc-url {rpc} --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key {key}`
contract MultisigScript is ScriptSuite {
    string public constant ADDRESSES_PATH = "./addresses/addresses.json";

    constructor() ScriptSuite(ADDRESSES_PATH, new MULTISIG_01()) {}

    function run() public override {
        proposal.setDebug(true);

        // Execute proposal
        super.run();
    }
}
```

Ensure that the `DEV_MULTISIG` address corresponds to a valid Multisig Gnosis Safe contract. If this is not the case, the script will fail with the error: `Multisig address doesn't match Gnosis Safe contract bytecode`.

For those who wish to complete this tutorial on a local blockchain without needing to deploy a Gnosis Safe Account, modify the `MultisigScript` as follows:

```solidity
contract MultisigScript is ScriptSuite {
    string public constant ADDRESSES_PATH = "./addresses/addresses.json";

    constructor() ScriptSuite(ADDRESSES_PATH, new MULTISIG_01()) {}

    bytes public constant SAFE_BYTECODE =
        hex"608060405273ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff600054167fa619486e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060003514156050578060005260206000f35b3660008037600080366000845af43d6000803e60008114156070573d6000fd5b3d6000f3fea2646970667358221220d1429297349653a4918076d650332de1a1068c5f3e07c5c82360c277770b955264736f6c63430007060033";

    function run() public override {
        proposal.setDebug(true);

        // Set Gnosis Safe bytecode
        vm.etch(addresses.getAddress("DEV_MULTISIG"), SAFE_BYTECODE);

        // Execute proposal
        super.run();
    }
}
```

Running the script:

```sh
forge script script/MultisigScript.s.sol
```

The script will output the following:

```sh

A signer from the multisig address can check whether the calldata proposed on the multisig matches the calldata obtained from the call. It is important to note that two new addresses have been added to the `Addresses.sol` storage. These addresses are not included in the JSON file and must be added manually for accuracy.
