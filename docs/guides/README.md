# Guides 

FPS is designed to be loosely coupled, making it easy to integrate into any
governance model. Each of these governance models have their unique
specifications. To accommodate the unique requirements of different governance systems, FPS
introduces [proposal-specific](proposals/) contracts. Each contract is designed to align perfectly with the operational nuances of the respective governance model.

## Validated Governance Models

FPS's versatility and robustness have been validated through successful integration with leading governance models. To date, FPS has been tested and confirmed for compatibility with:
